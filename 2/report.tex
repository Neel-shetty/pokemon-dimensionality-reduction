\section{Introduction}

Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm in generative modeling, achieving remarkable success in high-quality image synthesis. The integration of transformer architectures with diffusion processes represents a significant advancement, addressing limitations of traditional convolutional approaches while enabling more sophisticated conditioning mechanisms and global context modeling.

This review examines eight pivotal works that demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of diffusion transformers across diverse applications. These range from fundamental architectural innovations like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) framework to specialized applications such as pose-guided generation and semantic matching. The papers collectively illustrate how transformer-based diffusion models are reshaping the landscape of generative AI.

\section{Image-to-Image Translation with CLIP Conditioning}

The first reviewed work addresses paired image-to-image translation by combining diffusion models with Vision Transformers (ViTs). The authors adapt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) framework and introduce a novel CLIP-based conditioning strategy. Instead of traditional text or class labels, the model is guided by image embeddings from a pre-trained CLIP encoder.

The methodology employs a composite loss incorporating CLIP similarity and LPIPS perceptual metrics to enforce semantic consistency and visual fidelity. Experiments on face2comics and edges2shoes datasets demonstrate superior performance over GAN-based baselines, particularly in preserving identity and structure while maintaining stylistic accuracy.

Key contributions include: (1) a DiT-based architecture for paired translation conditioned on CLIP image embeddings, and (2) a dual loss combining perceptual (LPIPS) and semantic (CLIP similarity) objectives. The approach leverages self-attention to capture global context, addressing GANs' difficulty with high-resolution details.

\section{Dynamic Compression with D2iT}

The D2iT paper addresses limitations of fixed compression in Diffusion Transformers by proposing a dynamic compression strategy tailored to image content. The framework introduces a two-stage system: first, a Dynamic VAE (DVAE) hierarchically encodes image regions at varying downsampling rates based on local detail; second, a Dynamic Diffusion Transformer predicts noise at multiple granularities corresponding to those regions.

This design combines a Dynamic Grain Transformer for coarse noise prediction with a Dynamic Content Transformer for detail correction. The approach unifies global consistency with local detail by adapting compression dynamically based on information density. Experimental validation across multiple benchmarks confirms that region-adaptive tokenization improves reconstruction accuracy and realism compared to uniform-compression DiT models.

\section{Linear Attention Efficiency with LiT}

LiT proposes a Linear Diffusion Transformer to drastically reduce transformer complexity while retaining performance. The key innovations include using linear attention with very few heads and a cost-effective training strategy leveraging a pre-trained full transformer teacher.

The methodology involves inheriting weights from a pre-trained DiT except for attention layers, and employing knowledge distillation that supervises both noise predictions and diffusion variance. Experiments on class-conditional ImageNet demonstrate that LiT achieves competitive FIDs with up to 80\% fewer training steps. The simplified linear attention and hybrid training yield an efficient diffusion transformer suitable for resource-constrained settings.

\section{Pose-Guided Generation with Stable-Pose}

Stable-Pose introduces an adapter module for Stable Diffusion aimed at improving pose-guided image generation. The approach employs a coarse-to-fine attention masking strategy within the vision transformer backbone to handle complex human poses more accurately.

The adapter works as a plug-in to pre-trained Stable Diffusion, using masked pose images to progressively refine attention maps from coarse body parts to finer joint details. A specially designed loss emphasizes pose regions during training. Evaluation on five datasets shows significant improvements over baselines like ControlNet, achieving 57.1 AP on LAION-Human compared to ControlNet's performance.

\section{Pure Transformer Architecture with DiffiT}

DiffiT investigates the use of Vision Transformers as denoising networks in diffusion models, proposing a hybrid U-shaped transformer architecture with time-dependent multi-head self-attention (TMSA). TMSA adapts attention behavior dynamically across diffusion timesteps, providing finer control over the denoising process.

The authors design both image-space and latent-space variants, targeting high resolution and computational efficiency respectively. Results show DiffiT surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion models, with latent DiffiT achieving FID 1.73 on ImageNet-256 using approximately 20\% fewer parameters than other transformer-based diffusion models.

\section{Scene Graph-Based Generation}

The scene graph-based generation work introduces a fully transformer-based pipeline for conditional image synthesis using graph-structured scene descriptions. A SGTransformer encodes scene graphs into object layouts, while an Image Transformer decodes these layouts into images via a VQ-VAE latent space.

By avoiding adversarial training, the model achieves improved image quality and diversity. The approach reports state-of-the-art results on Visual Genome, COCO, and CLEVR datasets, with Inception Score 13.7 on COCO and FID 52.3. The work demonstrates how transformer architectures can effectively handle structured conditional inputs.

\section{Semantic Matching with SD4Match}

SD4Match leverages Stable Diffusion as a backbone for dense semantic correspondence by tuning textual prompts embedded into the SD model. Three prompt-tuning strategies are explored: single global prompts, class-specific prompts, and a novel Conditional Prompting Module (CPM) that adapts prompts based on local image context.

The methodology achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on PF-Pascal, PF-Willow, and SPair-71k benchmarks, improving SPair-71k accuracy by approximately 12 percentage points. The work demonstrates how generative models can be repurposed for discriminative tasks through careful prompt engineering.

\section{Conditional Control with ControlNet}

ControlNet introduces an architecture to endow pretrained diffusion models with diverse spatial conditioning without retraining the base model. The approach "locks" weights of large diffusion models and attaches zero-initialized convolutional layers that learn to process control inputs like edges, depth maps, and poses.

The zero-initialization ensures initial output preservation while enabling gradual learning of control mechanisms. Extensive experiments show ControlNet can learn various conditioning tasks robustly using as little as 50K supervised examples, making it highly practical for deployment.

\section{Scaling with Rectified Flow}

The rectified flow work introduces models that linearize interpolation between data and noise distributions. The authors propose a new noise sampling schedule emphasizing perceptually important image scales and design a bi-modal transformer architecture for text-conditioned generation.

Large-scale experiments demonstrate that scaled-up rectified flow models can outperform traditional diffusion models on high-resolution benchmarks. The largest models (8B parameters) achieve superior FID and human preference scores, suggesting rectified flow as a viable alternative to standard diffusion processes.

\section{Structured Pattern Expansion}

The final work addresses generating large, structured, tileable patterns from small user-drawn exemplars. The approach fine-tunes pretrained diffusion models on pattern datasets using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and employs noise rolling techniques to ensure seamless tiling.

A patch-based sliding-window approach generates large outputs while preserving style and structure. The method produces diverse, coherent patterns outperforming baselines like Stable Diffusion and CNN-based texture models, demonstrating applicability to specialized generative tasks.

\section{Comparative Analysis and Discussion}

The reviewed works collectively demonstrate several key trends in diffusion transformer research:

\textbf{Architectural Innovation:} From pure transformer replacements (DiffiT) to hybrid approaches (D2iT), researchers are exploring various ways to integrate transformer capabilities with diffusion processes.

\textbf{Conditioning Mechanisms:} Novel conditioning strategies using CLIP embeddings, scene graphs, and spatial controls show how transformers enable more sophisticated input modalities beyond simple text prompts.

\textbf{Efficiency Improvements:} Linear attention (LiT) and dynamic compression (D2iT) address computational scalability while maintaining generation quality.

\textbf{Application Diversity:} The breadth of applications from semantic matching to pattern generation demonstrates the versatility of the diffusion transformer paradigm.

\section{Challenges and Future Directions}

Several challenges emerge across the reviewed works:

\textbf{Computational Requirements:} Most approaches require significant computational resources, limiting accessibility for smaller research groups and practical deployment.

\textbf{Training Stability:} While generally more stable than GANs, some methods still require careful hyperparameter tuning and specialized training procedures.

\textbf{Generalization:} Many approaches are tested on specific datasets or domains, with limited evaluation of cross-domain generalization.

\textbf{Control Granularity:} Balancing fine-grained control with model flexibility remains an ongoing challenge across conditioning approaches.

Future research directions include developing more efficient architectures, improving training stability, enabling better user control mechanisms, and expanding to video and 3D generation tasks.

\section{Conclusion}
